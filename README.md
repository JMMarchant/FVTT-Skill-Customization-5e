As you can see, this module adds a drop down to select the base ability, as well as a box to enter an arbitrary bonus to each skill.

## Compatibility

May or may not work with all custom sheets or modules that modify rolling.

Confirmed compatibility with Tidy5e Sheet, Alt5e Sheet, and Better Rolls for 5e.

Makes use of libWrapper to reduce likelihood of conflicts. Installing libWrapper is not required to make use of this module.
