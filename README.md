# Skill Customization for D&D5E

Provides a convenient one-click UI for changing the bonuses applied to a skill and the base ability a skill uses by default.

## Compatibility

Functionally, this should work with any module that works with core dnd5e skill checks.
However, custom sheet modules or modules that alter the dnd5e character sheet *may* cause visual conflicts, though that should be unlikely.
